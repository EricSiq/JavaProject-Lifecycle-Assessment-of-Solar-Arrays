What problems are we aiming to solve for the average Indian?
Assessing the true environmental and economic impact of solar panel installations in India is complex due to varied regional subsidies and sunlight conditions.
India lacks a dynamic tool for calculating the return on investment (ROI) and environmental footprint of solar panels that accounts for location-specific factors in India.
We lack the User-Awareness by Indian consumers and businesses in making informed decisions about solar panel installations.

Primary Objectives:
Develop a robust Java application that accurately calculates the lifecycle assessment of developing and maintaining solar panel installations across India.
Integrate a database to store and retrieve regional solar subsidy data provided by various local and state governmental bodies, ensuring accurate ROI calculations.
Create a user-friendly interface that simplifies complex calculations for users with varying technical expertise.


Secondary Objectives:
Enable users to input specific parameters such as panel type, system size, and location to personalize the assessment.
Ensure the application is scalable and maintainable, allowing for future updates and enhancements.
Promote awareness and adoption of solar energy in India through an accessible and informative tool focusing on localised data.
