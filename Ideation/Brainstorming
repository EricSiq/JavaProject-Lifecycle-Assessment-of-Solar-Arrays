In India, investing in renewable energy (solar or wind) depends on government subsidies, electricity tariffs, and local conditions. Your Java-based ROI calculator should consider the following factors:

Key Factors for ROI Calculation in India
1. Initial Investment Cost
Solar Panels Cost: â‚¹40,000â€“â‚¹60,000 per kW (residential); â‚¹30,000â€“â‚¹50,000 per kW (commercial)
Wind Turbine Cost: â‚¹6â€“â‚¹7 crores per MW (larger scale)
2. Government Incentives & Subsidies
Solar Subsidies:
30-40% subsidy for residential solar (PM-KUSUM, State DISCOM schemes)
Net Metering Policy: Sell excess electricity to the grid
Wind Incentives:
Accelerated Depreciation (AD) â€“ 40% tax benefit
Generation-Based Incentive (GBI) for grid-connected wind farms
3. Expected Energy Output
Solar: 4â€“6 kWh/day per kW installed (depends on location, sunlight hours)
Wind: 20-30% Capacity Factor (actual vs. theoretical output)
4. Electricity Tariff Savings
Commercial Electricity Rate: â‚¹6-â‚¹10 per kWh
Residential Electricity Rate: â‚¹4-â‚¹8 per kWh
Selling to Grid (Net Metering Feed-in Tariff): â‚¹3-â‚¹5 per kWh
5. Payback Period & ROI Calculation
ROI Formula:

Expected payback period for solar: 4-6 years
Expected payback period for wind: 8-12 years
